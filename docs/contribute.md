## Our mission

We are growing secureReturn and want to see it become a valuable resource to the reverse engineering and security community. Throughout the years, many of us have all leaned on the work, experience and guidance of others and existing communities before us to advance ourselves. Our goal is to be one of those resources through providing original high-quality technical content in the form of live streams, interactive workshops and blogs ontop of acting as a source of community-maintained resources and place of discussion. But we can't do that without the help of the community.

**Want to help but can't volunteer? You can always help support us via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/securereturn).**

## Volunteer roles

### Front-end web developer
Want to help us provide resources for the community? We are seeking someone to help build out the secureReturn website. As a front-end dev it will be your responsibility to develop React components and pages based on the provided style guide and design templates. With the aid of professional UX designs, you will still have the ability to have some creative freedom and shape what the face of what secureReturn looks like without being fully responsible for UX.

#### Expectations
* You are famaliar with responsive design and have good CSS skills.
* You know ReactJS and can build out components based on style guide and templates.
* You care about asthetics and can follow a "design system".

##### Other details
Currently the [secureReturn site](https://sec-r.et) is built on [docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) but is subject to change if it does not suit our needs. Likely candidate would be something similar to [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). We don't plan to deviate from a react based static site generator.

#### Apply

### Core content curator
We are looking for multiple people to assist in content curation. Everything from awesome lists, tool submissions, reviewing blog CFP submissions, job postings and more. Anyone can contribute to resources by opening a PR but you will help build that initial core content and support it by reviewing new submissions.
